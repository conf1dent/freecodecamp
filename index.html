            Chingiz Aytmatov, Aytmatov also spelled Aitmatov, 
            (born December 12, 1928, Sheker, Kirgiziya, U.S.S.R. 
            [now in Kyrgyzstan]—died June 10, 2008, Nürnberg, Germany), 
            author, translator, journalist, and diplomat, best known as 
            a major figure in Kyrgyz and Russian literature.
            Aytmatov’s father was a Communist Party official executed 
            during the great purges directed by Soviet leader Joseph 
            Stalin in the late 1930s. Aytmatov’s literary career started 
            in 1952, and in 1959 he began writing for Pravda as the 
            newspaper’s correspondent in Kirgiziya. He achieved major 
            recognition with the collection of short stories Povesti gor 
            i stepey (1963; Tales of the Mountains and Steppes), for which 
            he was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1963. Although Aytmatov 
            composed in both Russian and Kyrgyz, many of his works, 
            which are predominantly long short stories and novellas, 
            were originally written in the latter language. Major themes 
            in these works are love and friendship, the trials and heroism 
            of wartime, and the emancipation of Kyrgyz youth from 
            restrictive custom and tradition.
